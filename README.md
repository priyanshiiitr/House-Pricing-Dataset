## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains features such as:

- LotArea
- YearBuilt
- OverallQual
- TotalBsmtSF
- GrLivArea
- GarageCars
- FullBath
- Neighborhood
- SalePrice (target)

Dataset Source: *(Specify if it's from Kaggle, UCI ML Repo, or custom)*

## 🧪 Project Goals

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Preprocess and clean the data
- Engineer useful features
- Train and compare multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Evaluate model performance
- Save and deploy the best-performing model

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

📌 Future Improvements
Incorporate more advanced feature engineering

Add cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

Deploy using Flask / Streamlit for real-time predictions
